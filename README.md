This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com) project and uses `npm` as its package manager. For icons check out [Styled icons](https://styled-icons.dev/).

## Getting Started

First, make sure you have [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed to install the project's dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

then start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Branching strategy

This project uses a [Feature Branching](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow) strategy. This means that all new features are developed on a separate branch and merged into the `main` branch once they are ready to be deployed.

### Branch naming

Branches should be named using the following convention:

`feature/feature-name`  
`hotfix/hotfix-name`

## Commit messages

Commit messages should be written in the imperative mood, e.g. "Fix bug" and not "Fixed bug" or "Fixes bug".

## Pull requests

Pull requests should be named using the following convention:

`[feature/bug/chore/hotfix] feature-name`
